# Travel Booking Application

## Overview
This travel booking application is designed to allow users to search for and book travel options. The application is built using React for the frontend and PHP for the backend, providing a seamless user experience and robust server-side functionality.

## Frontend
The frontend of the application is developed using React. It includes the following key components:

- **Home Page**: The landing page where users can start their search for travel options.
- **Search Results Page**: Displays the results of the user's search query.
- **Booking Details Page**: Shows detailed information about a specific booking.
- **Booking Form**: A form that allows users to enter their booking details.

### Installation
To set up the frontend, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Frontend
To start the frontend development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

## Backend
The backend of the application is built using PHP. It handles user authentication, booking management, and payment processing.

### Installation
To set up the backend, navigate to the `backend` directory and run:

```bash
composer install
```

### Running the Backend
The backend can be run using a local server or through Docker. Ensure that the database is configured correctly in the `.env` file.

## Database
The application uses a database to store user and booking information. The SQL script for creating the bookings table can be found in the `backend/migrations` directory.

## Docker
This application can be run using Docker. Ensure that Docker is installed and configured on your machine. To start the application, run:

```bash
